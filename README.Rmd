An RStudio addin to provide easy and interactive time series visualization.
To be visible to the addin, time series must be stored in a dataframe in the global environment, with:

- at least a column of type *Date*
- at least a column of type *numeric*

## Installation

You can install the released version of tsviz from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran_install}
# install.packages("tsviz")
```

Or install the development version from Github:

```{r github_install}
# devtools::install_packages("donlelef/tsviz")
```

Once youâ€™ve installed the package, you donâ€™t need to load it with `library()`, the addins are installed on your machine as part of the package install process.

## Example

First, let us load some suitable data:

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(tsviz)
prices <- crypto_prices
```

Then, we can run the addin:

That's it.
